# FlashCards Starter Kit

**FlassCards** is a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line! A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

This project includes three extensions in addition to functionality above: a second dataset written by the author, implementation of the second dataset for a second round of the game, and a timer that captures and displays how long it took to complete a each round.

## Initial Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:


## How to View Code in Action

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to start your server to test your functionality.
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```
